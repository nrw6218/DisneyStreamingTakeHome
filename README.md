# Disney Streaming Take Home

This is a simple JavaScript application meant to mimic the landing page of a streaming service with selectable content tiles the user can scroll through.

## Getting Started
To run the application, move to the project directory in the terminal and run `npm run build`. This will bundle the JavaScript files and allow you to run the application by opening the `index.js` file in your browser.

## Available Commands
### `"npm run build": "webpack"`,

Bundles all javascript modules together and puts the bundled js file in teh `/dist` directory.

### `"npm run watch": "webpack --watch"`,

Runs webpack in watch mode so `bundle.js` will update as you save changes to the project. Good for while actively developing.

## Built With
- JavaScript
- Node
- NPM
- Webpack
- HTML
- CSS
